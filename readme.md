# HybridSync
An unfinished discord sync bot designed to be released to the public on spigotmc.

**NOTE:** This is an old plugin and is very unstable. A newer version was started but is equally unfinished.

### Features
- Integrated discord bot using JDA
- Litebans hook
- PlaceholderAPI Support
- Fully configurable
- 

### Warning
This plugin was never finished, and will never be finished by me. Many of the commands have gone untested and may not be fully stable.
